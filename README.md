How BaT does there count downs. 
They will display days unitl the last 24 hours at which time they will then convert from 1 day to hh:mm:ss left in the auction.
We need to display the normal days format from their website until they start displaying the hh:mm:ss format at which time we should then switch over and use that. We should also then update our database for that listing to have that experation time on our listing.
